## 🌾 GrassBeGone - No More Annoying Grass

Sometimes you find the perfect flat land to build your base—only to see it covered in grass everywhere. So you spend time breaking them one by one or flooding them with water, only to end up with a backpack full of unwanted seeds.

**This mod is made for that exact pain.**  
By default, it disables the generation of `minecraft:grass` (not including tall grass, so you can still obtain seeds the usual way).  
You can also configure **GrassBeGone.toml** to blacklist the generation of specific plants—including those from other mods.  
**It does not affect bone meal use**—bone meal can still grow grass and flowers as usual.

有时候你找到了一块不错的平地，正想建造基地，却发现地上全是草。你只好一点点打掉或用水冲走，结果又捡了一地种子，把背包塞得满满的。

**本模组就是为了解决这个问题。**  
默认禁止生成 `minecraft:grass`（不包括 tall_grass，高草依然可以打种子），  
你也可以在配置文件 **GrassBeGone.toml** 中，禁止生成特定的花草（包括其他模组添加的）。  
**它不会影响骨粉催生草和花的机制。**
